Low Light Imaging for Mobile Phones

Mobile phones have become a staple for every personâ€™s needs. Further, cameras in mobile phones have started to compete against professional cameras developed only for photography. But due to limited hardware and space constraints in a mobile phone, cameras are unable to outperform the professional cameras. The sensors used in mobile phones are far inferior to the ones found in professional cameras. Of the few spaces that mobile cameras lack, is low light images. Mobile cameras have been using flash for the past few years to enable the user to capture images in low light. But the images captured do not truly see what the human eyes had intended to see. We aim to enable mobile cameras to be able to compete with the professional cameras through the use of artificial intelligence. The techniques we aim to use are based on software and hence do not add to the cost of building the mobile phone. Our method abandons the traditional image processing pipeline to move to a more data driven pipeline that is built using examples of similar past experiences rather than the image priors, which are details of images that are known prior to the image even being captured. Abandoning the traditional pipeline helps us to achieve a more data driven approach.
